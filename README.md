<h1 align="center">Simplify checking the surf forecast</h1>

GoSurf is a fullstack web application that aims to simplify checking the surf forecast for your local surf spot in a clean but simplistic UI/UX.

The concept for GoSurf is based on the fact that modern day surf tracking sites and applications are extremely noisy, and difficult to understand.

Want to know more about how it works? Have a look at the [GoSurf "Serverless" Backend](https://github.com/ryan-neil/gosurf/tree/main/server).

This repository contains the GoSurf source code. This repo is a work in progress, so we appreciate your patience as we figure things out.
