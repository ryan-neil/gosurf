<h1 align="center">Simplify checking the surf forecast</h1>

GoSurf is a modern web application that aims to simplify checking the surf forecast for your local surf spot in a clean but simplistic UI/UX.

The concept for GoSurf is based on the fact that modern day surf tracking sites and applications are extremely noisy, and difficult to understand.
